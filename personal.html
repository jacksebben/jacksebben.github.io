                    <h3>Hi, I'm Jack Sebben!</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hello, and welcome!
                        My name is Jack Sebben, and I'm a full-time student for Rochester Institute of Technology and a part-time Software Developer for Pixit HQ (Chicago, IL).
                        I started this website to promote myself and my work to prospective employers, and I'm thrilled to be able to share my passions with you.
                        I've always been interested in computers and programming from a young age. Through my experiences, I've developed a deep understanding of writing software and developing games.
                        If you are interested in hiring, or simply want to get in contact with me, you can do so through my LinkedIn on the homepage.
                        if you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to reach out - I'd love to hear from you!

                    <h3>My Interests</h3>
                    <p>
                        Related to Computer Science, I enjoy programming games in my free time.
                        Often times I plan out and execute ideas by myself, but I also enjoy working together with friends and other people I know.
                        Some of my friends and I are even currently working on a game that I hope to release information for in the near future.
                        I am also a very big fan of mathematics.
                        I've always enjoyed math, even throughout school (evident through my participation in my high school's math team).
                        In the same vein, I enjoy robotics and used to be on my high school's robotics team.
                        We were invited to state my freshman year, and it was wonderful!
                        I also did theatre during my time at high school, through which I gained lots of friends and wonderful experiences.
                        In my free time, I'm learning German in hope of studying abroad for more Computer Science education.
                        I've always wanted to learn German and visit Europe, so I'm very excited to see what the future holds.

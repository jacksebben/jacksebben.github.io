                            This e-store project is a web-based application built using the Angular framework for the frontend and the Spring framework for the backend.
                            The application allows users to purchase various country flags and customize their own flags using predetermined designs.
                            This project involved learning the Agile method of software engineering alongside other team members who also contributed.

                        <p>
                            The music database project is a web application that allows users to create accounts, log in, search for songs, play songs, create playlists, add friends, and view popular songs.
                            The frontend of the application is implemented in Java with a command-line interface.
                            The backend of the application is the relational database management system (RDBMS) of PostgreSQL, which uses SQL to store and retrieve user information, songs, playlists, and friend relationships.
                            The application follows a client-server architecture, where the Java-based frontend interacts with the RDBMS backend to fetch and display data to the user.
